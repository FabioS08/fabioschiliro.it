## 📖 About
This repository hosts the source code of my personal portfolio website, built as a **single-page experience** with an animated intro and a **glassmorphism dashboard** layout


## ✨ Key Features
- **Animated intro** (logo + SVG signature reveal on scroll)
- **Glass dashboard UI** with tabs (*About Me* / *Projects*)
- **Responsive layout** for mobile/desktop
- **Project Showcase** generated dynamically by fetching my public GitHub repositories via the GitHub API, then rendering them as glass cards with custom cover images and showing priorities
